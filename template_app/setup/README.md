# Installation

1. Install [Miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (this instruction
is for Python 3.6). I suggest not adding Miniconda to the PATH unless you
have a reason - the app starts nicely via shortcut to be created.
    * on Windows installation is straight-forward,
    * this is [Linux installation instruction](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/linux.html),
    * this is [macOS installation instruction](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/macos.html).

2. _(optional)_ Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Install instructions are
  straight-forward. Another option on macOS is to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
  On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal
  the very first time.

       git --version

    If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

2. Make sure conda is callble from terminal  
(I assume that you didn't change default Miniconda3 
install dir)
    * on Windows:

          cd /d %UserProfile%\Miniconda3\Scripts
          set "PATH=%PATH%;%cd%"

    * on Unix (Linux/macOS):

          cd ~/miniconda3/bin
          export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"

3. Go to this dir and run:
    * on Windows (copy dir's path from the explorer):

          cd /d <ThisDir>
          conda env create --file env_win.yaml

    * on Unix (Linux/macOS) (drag'n'drop the dir to the terminal window):

          cd <ThisDir>
          conda env create --file ./env_unix.yaml

   * Important: do not specify custom `-p` / `--prefix` path: this might make shortcut creation fail.
4. If you need - Uninstall env:

        conda env remove --name app
